                        <p>After completing grad school, the goal was to create my own studio and use what I'd shared in the thesis 
                            that earned my masters degree as the foundation for doing so. While playing with a few concepts and 
                            trying to settle on my first project, since I was free of the 2 and half year crunch on my thesis, the 
                            assistant general manager at my day job knew I could model and created environments during my schooling and 
                            came to me with a request.

                        <p>The company was going through several changes at the time, and even though I was not part of management, 
                            they always welcomed my ideas and treated me as if I were one of the management team. Naturally, when 
                            you love someone or something you become passionate about making the world around that love better. The 
                            people at Lucky Strike were like an extended part of my family.

                        <p>So, when the AGM came asking for ideas on how to pretty up a particularly ugly wall and try making it a focal 
                            point rather than an eye sore, I dove in head over heels.

                        <p>From there, redesigning a single wall quickly turned into redesigning an adjacent room. A room grew to the entire venue. 
                            Very soon, it blew up into a multi-purpose virtual tour, and is still my largest project to date.

                            Partly due to sometimes enjoying precision a bit more than most. But this project, needing a scale model of 
                            the whole venue and everything it contained, was all about detail. And, that made it a perfect fit for my 
                            creative drive.

                            simple structural pieces, down to the salt and pepper shakers, everything in the venue was taken into 
                            account even if it may not have made it into the final build.

                        <p>Since the project was to display suggested updates, the only thing that changed was the styling. When the 
                            models were imported and assembled in-engine, a prefab was created that had a Unity spotlight attached. 
                            With the model built to have pivot points like the real world version, they too could be angled any 
                            direction.

                            them, based on how bright they are and their immediate environment.

                        <p>This was used on all the lights, but emphasized most at both the dining and Einstein bars, as well as around

                            one asset to another, like  wall seams and corners, of which the venue obviously had many.

                        <p>After building out a large portion of the virtual venue, the 'touring' side of the project needed to be 
                            fulfilled. The first step to this was designing a way of interfacing with the experience in both the VR 
                            and WebGL builds. And using Unitys world-space UI canvas setup worked great for a semi-directed and 
                            semi-interactive experience such as this.

                            location of the venue they are taking the tour of. And it wouldn't be much of tour without a guide.

                            cover. Things that would make the tour drag on forever, and may not be important to everyone. Like reading

                            giving them buttons that opened menus, answered frequently asked questions and gave them nagivational choices. 
                            Like which pause point to move to.

                            being animated to follow the guide as they talked about things along the way. At specific points, as shown 
                            in the tour map, the guide would pause its movement, finish its presentation of that section and give the 
                            viewer some options to select from, as explained in the UI/UX section. 
                            </p>

                        <p>The option they had to select for the tour to continue was one of the navigation choices that consisted of a

                        <p>Many of the designs shown in the images and videos throughout this project came from a repetitive process, 
                            that aimed to fit within the scope of having a modern industrial theme with a techy vibe to it. Something 
                            that presented itself as being up-to-date San Francisco. But also something that wasn't just aesthetic. It 
                            was also functional. One of my favorite types of design!

                        <p>The design process involved creating quick versions of an in-engine build that could be shared with 
                            fellow staff members, management and non-management. Gather several thoughts, opinions and even further 
                            specific requests from management at varying levels. Then, taking all that and fuse it into another build that 
                            was again shared for the feedback.

                        <p>The design for the wall that started it all seemed straight forward to me. The wall ran parallel to the walls 
                            that gave the bowling section its length, and faced the same way as the backdrop that gave the lanes their 
                            visual appeal above the pins. 
                            </p>
                        <p>Extending what already existed the rest of the way down the wall connected the once very separate areas. 
                            The greyish-white around the black x pattern played in well with the white floors of the Einstein Room 
                            that had black highlights in it. And made the Control Desk, where you go to bowl or play games, stand out 
                            more. Expressing it as the obvious hub for both areas as it should have been from the beginning.

                        <p>Another part of the design came from the backdrop only coming 2/3 of the way down the wall. The remaining

                            the functional part plays in.

                        <p>Lucky Strike is known for their parties. It's also one of their largest revenue streams. From small family fun 
                            days, to massive things like hosting Super Bowl 50 where set up took over a month to complete. Small or massive, 
                            this particular wall was used for different table setups and of course taking pictures in front of the step and 
                            repeat background that was to be featured there. With that meant the lower section got hit alot, which left 
                            holes far more often than would be preferred.

                        <p>Even though the request to redesign the step and repeat wall was technically what started the project, it 
                            was being able to redesign a room that was named after one of my personal historic heros that shoved it 
                            toward what it ended up being. Every Lucky Strike venue at the time had a unique theme to it. And Albert 
                            Einstein was a part of San Francisco.

                        <p>The orignal design of the room was very plain and only had a single mural on a single wall despite the whole 
                            room being named after him. And it really didn't show the genius that his work obviously was. So I set out 
                            to display his life on all the surfaces that would hold something worth admiring for a while, including the 
                            ceiling.

                        <p>Before getting too far with alot of detail, let me point out that with this room extending from the dining room, and its 
                            high ceilings, all glass store front that pointed toward the southern sun all day, and both rooms bathed in bright white, 
                            the space felt glaring from certain perspectives or washed out and hidden from others.

                        <p>The idea to immediately make the room stand out from the rest was to apply a direct color contrast by 
                            expanding the flat black of the original Einstein mural to all the walls and the ceiling, as mentioned above.
                            With the right lighting, especially at night when they dim the overhead lights and the venue holds more of a night 
                            club vibe, you can't help but gravite toward the room and want to hangout even without all the art and features

                            we really know him for, the theories of relativity, need the space to even attempt a meaningful depiction 
                            of something so beautiful. The images below show the rough concepts of what was to be a massive mural 
                            containing both on the left, and on the right placeholder images used in Unity for testing placement and

                        <p>The back wall, opposite the dining room, was primarily consumed by a long glass window that looked out over 
                            the lanes with a narrow wall bar beneath it. Like every other part of this room, most people never noticed 
                            the window until it was right in from of them.

                        <p>Along with it being surrounded by the flat black color, the fix here was to outline the glass with a bead of 
                            lights. Tuned to the right color and level of illumination, this created an appealing transition point. 
                            Helping to highlight features of the bowling alley on other side, like the "Lucky Strike" sign at the far 
                            end. Resulting in the viewer being pulled through the venue just by giving them an interesting way of realizing 
                            there was more to it.

                            together. Both simple, yet still very important to the overall tribute. Looking at the wealth of knowledge 
                            Albert discovered for us with his huge personality and imagination, as well as parts of his ealier life that is never credited enough.

                            was one of them. Even though he was better at piano, and more so with the violin, this image seemed to carry 
                            more of the chilled vibe. With him kicked back, strumming out a tune in his flat cap. Very much what the 
                            venue was being designed around.

                        <p>From the ceiling down the greatest portion of the walls and pillars could remain white. Helping to create a 
                            clean and open feeling with the ceilling being so high, in addition to helping bounce light around the room, 
                            especially at night.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>Equal to the height of the half wall in the Einstein Room, a piece of wood trim stained to the same shade as 
                            the wood on the half wall, would have been placed around all the walls and pillars to separate them into upper 
                            and lower sections. Then everything in the lower would become a passive grey. 
                            </p>

                    <div class="project-text">
                        <p>This fixed alot of the style. But like the bottom of the step and repeat wall, these walls got hit by chairs and 
                            tables being moved around. Causing a huge amount of work to keep it all repaired and professional looking. So, 
                            many things resolved with a couple simple steps.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>Next was correcting the largest feature the venue contained. The dining room bar that sat at 40 feet long by 
                            18 feet wide, right in the middile of the room. The scale made it impressive. But that white base and open 
                            space between the halo of railroad ties above it made it feel, again, out of place and incomplete.
                            </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="project-text">
                        <p>The 2 images above show the update base color to be a few shades darker than the dining room walls and pillar 
                            were suggested to be. More of an middle ground between the dining room grey and the Einstein black. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>Then, in combination with a string of lights running the under side of the bar as well as the top side of the halo,
                            adding a decorative set of iron looking rings to the cables suspending above halo the bar, broke up the negative 
                            space between it and the ceiling, and crowned the feature every guest is immediately introduced to as they enter the venue 
                            in an interesting way.
                            </p>

                    <div class="column text-portion left">
                        <p>The last remodeling update that went into the room was some other lighting pieces. For this, stylized barrel 
                            lights my friend and co-worker Carlos and I came up with, which were barrels cut in half that had a light 
                            element built inside. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>The opening would have been covered with a piece of white tinted plexi-glass, with the red Lucky Strike 
                            letters embedded in it. Each one to be hung from the ceiling by decorative iron chains and rings, bringing 
                            the room together into one clean and complete theme.
                            </p>
