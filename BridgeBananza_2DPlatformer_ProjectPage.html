                        <p>Being probably my favorite project so far, and my first project that went from concept to launch, this was a 
                            six week sprint during a prototyping class in grad school. 1 of 2 sprints where we were all challenged to 
                            pitch a game idea and then break up into groups based on the pitches we each presented to each other, with 
                            most sacrificing their ideas to help bring someone elses to life. As it often can be in many big name studios.

                        <p>There was two of us on this particular project. The smallest team in the class, and our workload was split 
                            according to our desired fields at the time. And worked out very nicely. My partner Will Burke, was the 
                            better artist and knew a fair share of coding. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>This allowed us to find some common ground that we took advantage of when it came time for the integration of 
                            all the pieces that made it through design and development process that resulted in the finshed game. The 
                            integration actually being my largest contribution beyond what you'll see below.

                        <p>My aim with the level design was to fulfill 3 primary tasks: 
                            <br><br>
                        - Metrics: Establish scale and movement parameters <br>
                        - Bridge piece type/ quantity: Design the types of pieces the player uses to build their bridge that fit 
                            the primary mechanics of the game. Then, tested each level to determine the number of pieces it would 
                            take based on the intended difficulty curve <br>
                        - Difficulty curve: Design and test a series of level setups to find a challenging but fun experience 
                            in only a few short scenarios
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-text">
                        <p>Once all the needed parts of the metrics were flushed out, like how far or high the monkey moved per 
                            stride or leap, multiple types of bridge building elements were chosen that fit a jungle setting. Then 
                            tested repeatedly to see how they felt during assembly, as well as how they reacted when their physics 
                            were turned back on and the monkey was released to make its run. Of about a dozen types, 4 were chosen:
                            </p>

                            done constructing their bridge(s): <br><br>
                            - Bamboo: long and skinny, can fall over very easy when stood on end <br>
                            - Rock Slabs and Logs: short, thick and heavy <br>
                            - Boulders: heavy and they roll

                        <p>Having just 6 weeks to accomplish the project between only 2 of us, some things had to be trimmed back as 
                            time began to run out. The number of levels needed to be compressed so that the overall experience 
                            still held a challenging yet fun difficulty curve. And so that the project could be completed with a 
                            clean and very presentable game.

                        <p>Level 1, like most games, was the tutorial explaining how to select, rotate and move the bridge pieces. And 
                            then how turn on the physics and release the monkey when the player felt they wanted to try their bridge out. 
                            This is also the only level that the monkey couldn't die, and players allowed to toggle back and forth between 
                            the construction and play modes by pressing the "Reset Pieces" button in the bottom right of the screen.

                        <p>The next level increases the challenge with a set of spikes and a bottomless pit. But there is a 
                            section between them intended to give the player a brief moment of relief.

                        <p>Finally, in the last level, getting the giant banana should of course be the most difficult. Not too 
                            much has changed in this level but the releif point between the spikes and the bottomless pit is 
                            replaced by more spikes, and there was a slight overhang at the far end of the pit to give the player 
                            an advantage in level 2. The size of the pit was designed to be barely jumpable from one edge to the 
                            other. So the removal of just those 2 pieces made the run quite a bit more challenging.

                            easier as well. If you notice that the extended spikes in level 3 were just overlayed by the relief point 
                            in level 2, and the overhang on the far side of the pit was just a couple of the rock slab bridge pieces that 
                            were unusable by the player. All of which was basically just turned on for one level and then turned off 
                            for the next.

                        <p>Another crucial part of developing the gameplay, especially during the initial metrics design period, was 
                            building the character controller. This was primarily done with a 3D capsule that Unity provides with the 
                            typical PC controls that I coded for the running and jumping.

                        <p>The other half of my UI contributions were to set up the gameplay elements that kept the player informed 
                            through each of the levels, like...  
                            <br><br>
                        - The number of lives they had (accompanied by coin at top left) <br>
                        - How many banana points had been collected throughout the game (accompanied by banana at top right) <br>
                        - And a temporary popup message to let the player know that a life or some banana points had been collected and 
                        their value (at center screeen)
                            </p>

                    <div class="project-text">
                        <p>One of the most important elements of the game, if not the most important, was the Construction/ Play Mode 
                            Toggle. It was what separated the ability to make bridges without the interference physics.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>When a level opened it was automatically set to Construction Mode, and the image of the crane in the UI at 
                            the top center of the screen was highlighted. This meant all physics were turned off as mentioned. But it 
                            also meant that the bridge pieces provided in each level could be selected and manipulated to build the 
                            bridges, and the monkey stayed in place as it was not yet controllable.

                        <p>Typically, with the exception of the tutorial level, the Play Mode side of the UI was the only clickable 
                            element. When selected, the ability to select bridge pieces was turned off, physics was turned on and 
                            applied to all applicable elements, including the monkey that also became controllable. And finally, the 
                            Play Mode side of the UI was highlighted to indicate that the game was then in play mode.

                        <p>To help make the game fun, like most, a system of reward was created and installed. It basically followed the 
                            standard for games such as this. The collection of a theme based piece (the bananas), and the bonus of 
                            collecting lives (the coins).
                            </p>
                        <p>Adding up to an arbitrary perfect score of 6,740 points in total if everything is collected and the player never 
                            dies. Which, especially in trying to get that giant banana, could be very challenging when everything went 
                            into motion!
